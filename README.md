# Steel Plate Fault Classification

This project focuses on classifying faults in steel plates using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is `faults (1).csv` and the main analysis is performed in `Project.ipynb`.

## Project Structure
- `faults (1).csv`: Dataset containing steel plate fault data.
- `Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aashmitbhasin03/Steel-Plate-Fault-Classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages (see below).
3. Open `Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
- Run the cells in `Project.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis and results.
- Modify the notebook to experiment with different models or preprocessing steps.
